# GalaxyJarGift
 Its kinda hard to explain


"You stepped into my world like a galaxy bursting in front of an astonomers telescope. Tell me, with all those speckles on your skin, did anyone tell you that you are a constellation waiting to be loved and explored?"

I present you: the reason I'm known as *"the guy who goes above and beyond for his gf"*: The galaxy jar.

# What it is / What it does

When you tap the lid of the mason jar, it lights up LEDs in the interior of the LED, as well as the lights on any other Galaxy Jar connected to the internet.

(add some pictures)

(if you want me to make you a set, send me an email: n.biancolin[at]mail.utoronto.ca)

# MATERIALS NEEDED:

## Tech Stuffs (from amazon):

- 2 ESP8266 Development Boards (I used these ones from KeeYees on Amazon, but any board like it will do: https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B07S5Z3VYZ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details )
- WS2182B light strip (Mine was 1m with 60 leds/m, but this part is up to you)
- 4 x 2xAAA battery holders
- 8 x AAA batteries
- 2 x 220 ohm resistor, 4 x 10k ohm resistor
- A bunch of misc wires and stuff
- Soldering iron + solder & flux


## Crafty Stuff
==*(You should know I am by no means a crafty person, and a lot of these went to waste bc it took me a few tries to get everything right)*==
- 2 small-ish mason jars 
- Poly-fill "stuffing" (think like stuffed-animal stuffing)
- Rit DyeMore synthetic dye, graphite colour
- 2 toilet paper rolls

## Other stuff I used that I had lying around
- A bunch of wires
- 

# How I made it

\*cue Ted from HIMYM's Voice\*: *"It really wasn't that hard. 
All I had to do was buy some microcontrollers and some other parts off of amazon. Realize that you need to buy other LEDs. Go and buy other LEDs. Learn how Socket.IO works, and try and build a server. Give up and beg your friend to set it up for you. (in hindsight it lowkey was not that complex and and I could have probably figure it out, but I am so grateful for Nathan's help). Realize that the wifi modules don't work. Buy new microcontrollers with wifi modules built in. Try 5 different libraries for connecting the controllers to socket.io server with no luck. Finally get it to work on a whim. Realize that the batteries you bought have too high of a voltage and are going to fry the controllers. Find a way to make the right voltage frantically a couple nights before. Solder everything together, Re-solder half of the connections because they were soldered incorrectly. Realize that capacitive touch sensors don't work when powered solely by batteries bc there is no ground, and frantically try and find a way to make it work. Finally get everything working after a month and a bit of every single hurdle that could ever*

lmao it was certainly a challenge to do this all, but I learned a lot and I'm realy happy with the end result.
